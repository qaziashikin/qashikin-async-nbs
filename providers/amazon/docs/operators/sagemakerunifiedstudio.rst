Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio
===============================

`Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio <https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/unified-studio/>`__ (SMUS) is a unified development experience that
brings together AWS data, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) services.
It provides a place to build, deploy, execute, and monitor end-to-end workflows from a single interface.
This helps drive collaboration across teams and facilitate agile development.

Airflow provides different operators for running artifacts in SageMaker Unified Studio. Be sure to read the descriptions 
below to understand which operator is best suited for your use case.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

To use these operators, you must do a few things:

  * Create a SageMaker Unified Studio domain and project, following the instruction in `AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/getting-started.html>`__.
  * If the domain is an IdC domain, navigate to the "Compute > Workflow environments" tab, and click "Create" to create a new MWAA environment.
  * Create a Jupyter notebook, querybook, Visual ETL job, or SageMaker Unified Studio notebook and save it to your project.

Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:SageMakerNotebookOperator:

Run Jupyter notebooks, Querybooks, and Visual ETL jobs
======================================================

Use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.sagemaker_unified_studio.SageMakerNotebookOperator`
to execute Jupyter notebooks, querybooks, and visual ETL jobs. This operator relies on the ``sagemaker_studio`` 
Python library to execute these artifacts.

The artifact is identified by its relative file path within the project (e.g. ``test_notebook.ipynb``).

.. exampleinclude:: /../../amazon/tests/system/amazon/aws/example_sagemaker_unified_studio.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sagemaker_unified_studio_notebook]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sagemaker_unified_studio_notebook]

.. _howto/operator:SageMakerUnifiedStudioNotebookOperator:

Run SageMaker Unified Studio notebooks
===============================================

Use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.sagemaker_unified_studio_notebook.SageMakerUnifiedStudioNotebookOperator`
to execute SMUS notebooks through the DataZone ``StartNotebookRun`` API.

The notebook is identified by its notebook ID (e.g. ``nb-1234567890``), along with the domain ID and project ID 
where the notebook resides.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../amazon/tests/system/amazon/aws/example_sagemaker_unified_studio_notebook.py

    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sagemaker_unified_studio_notebook]
