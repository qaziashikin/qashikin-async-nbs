    Watches an asynchronous notebook run, triggering when it reaches a terminal state.

    Uses a custom boto waiter (``notebook_run_complete``) defined in
    ``waiters/datazone.json`` to poll the DataZone ``GetNotebookRun`` API.

    :param notebook_run_id: The ID of the notebook run to monitor.
    :param domain_id: The ID of the DataZone domain.
    :param project_id: The ID of the DataZone project.
    :param waiter_delay: Interval in seconds between polls (default: 10).
    :param waiter_max_attempts: Maximum number of poll attempts.
    :param aws_conn_id: The Airflow connection used for AWS credentials.
    :param timeout_configuration: Optional timeout settings. When provided, the maximum
        number of poll attempts is derived from ``run_timeout_in_minutes * 60 / waiter_delay``.
        Defaults to a 12-hour timeout when omitted.
